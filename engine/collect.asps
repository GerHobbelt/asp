# Sequence conversion functions.
# If no argument is given, an empty sequence is returned. Otherwise, both
# functions accept a single argument and convert it as appropriate. In the case
# of a tuple being passed to the tuple function, no new tuple is created; the
# given tuple object is simply returned.
