# Asp application function specifications - iterators.

# Iterator creation function.
# The iterator is positioned on the first item, if applicable.
def iter(iterable) = AspLib_iter

# Iterator advance.
# Returns the referenced value, advancing the iterator in the process.
def next(iterator, end = None) = AspLib_next

# Note: Use conversion to bool to test an iterator. A value of False
# indicates an iterator at its end.
