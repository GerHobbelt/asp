Asp change log
==============

The following is a history of changes to the Asp software, in reverse
chronological order.

Changes
-------

Version 1.1.1.2 (compiler 1.1.0.1, engine 1.1.1.0):
- Compiler:
  - Fixed a code generation issue with return statements enclosed inside for
    loops.

Version 1.1.1.1 (compiler 1.1.0.0, engine 1.1.1.0):
- Unit tests:
  - Updated the unit test driver for testing the red-black tree implementation.
    This code is normally not compiled (as it does not contribute to the
    installed components), but if enabled in recent versions, it was failing to
    compile because of the changes to the AspCount function signature
    introduced in version 1.1.0.0.

Version 1.1.1.0 (compiler 1.1.0.0, engine 1.1.1.0):
- Engine:
  - Separated the script math function definitions into their own library for
    the benefit of applications that don't need them, and therefore don't need
    their dependencies (i.e., various C math routines).
- Build:
  - Added a CPack-based packaging script for building several source and
    binary packages, including an installer for Windows systems.

Version 1.1.0.0 (compiler 1.1.0.0, engine 1.1.0.0):
- Compiler:
  - Added string literal folding for explicit concatenation (+ operator) and
    juxtaposition.
  - Improved error reporting.
- Engine:
  - Changed the default value of the range start component (i.e., the value
    assumed when a range's start value is left unspecified, e.g., ..5).
    Previously it was always zero. Now, it is -1 if the step is negative, and
    zero otherwise.
  - Added allowing of Boolean values as range components, converting them to
    integers in the usual way.
  - Added missing range operations, all of which can be computed
    mathematically:
    - Length, i.e., the number of elements in a range.
    - Element indexing.
    - Membership test.
    - Slicing, which produces a new range object.
  - Added handling of unbounded ranges/slices.
  - Added reversed iterators.
  - Made the following API function changes:
    - AspRangeValues: Added an extra parameter to indicate whether the range is
      bounded.
    - AspCount: Changed to return AspRunResult since it can now fail in certain
      situations (e.g., unbounded ranges).
    - AspNewIterator: Added an extra parameter to indicate the type of iterator
      to create, normal (i.e., forward) or reversed.
    - New functions:
      - AspIsIterator, AspIsFunction, AspIsModule.
      - AspRangeElement: Return the integer value at the specified index.
      - AspTraceFile (only available in debug builds): Redirect trace output to
        the specified file handle.
  - Made the following changes to script-callable functions:
    - iter: Now accepts an iterator for the argument and creates a copy of it
      (unlike Python, which returns a reference to the same object). The
      iterator's current position is retained in the copy.
    - tuple and list: These functions no longer accept None as an argument,
      making them more like their Python counterparts.
    - New functions:
      - range_values: Return a 3-tuple of the components of a range.
      - reversed: Return a reversed iterator for a given collection or range.
        Passing an existing iterator makes a copy and reverses its direction.
- Standalone application:
  - Added extra options in debug builds for redirecting trace and dump outputs.

Version 1.0.0.3 (compiler 1.0.0.2, engine 1.0.0.0):
- Build:
  - Added the VERSION property to several of the targets to support
    installation of multiple versions of the tools on a given host. The
    versions of all installed libraries and executables are now aligned.

Version 1.0.0.2 (compiler 1.0.0.2, engine 1.0.0.0):
- Compiler:
  - Reverted lexical analysis treatment of negative integers due to problems
    scanning, for example, binary subtraction expressions with no intervening
    spaces. Decimal number tokens are now always positive and a preceding unary
    minus sign invokes constant expression folding, as it was prior to compiler
    version 0.7.2.0 (Asp version 0.7.4.0). New logic has been added to allow
    expression of the constant integer value -2147483648 (INT32_MIN).

Version 1.0.0.1 (compiler 1.0.0.1, engine 1.0.0.0):
- Compiler:
  - Changed the way the compiler searches for import modules. Previously, the
    current working directory was searched by default. Now, the directory in
    which the main module resides is searched instead. This includes when blank
    entries are used in the ASP_INCLUDE environment variable.
  - Fixed a minor bug in the compiler with command line file name suffix
    checking.

Version 1.0.0.0 (compiler 1.0.0.0, engine 1.0.0.0):
- Compiler:
  - Changed the order of searching for the application specification file to
    prioritize an app.spec file in the same directory as the source file over
    the one specified by the ASP_SPEC_FILE environment variable.
  - Fixed a bug that caused incorrect code to be generated for some tuple
    expressions and some structured target expressions in for statements.
- Engine:
  - Added new script-callable functions: module, exists, id, exit, and key.
  - Added the ability for the "in" operator to check for the existence of a
    symbol within a module or the local scope (represented by the Ellipsis).
  - Fixed a bug with the "in" operator that caused it to return False when
    presented invalid typed operands instead of generating an error.
  - Added the __main__ variable for use in checking if the current module is
    the main module.
  - Added a distinct error code to indicate invalid application function
    behaviour (instead of using the same error code that indicates a malformed
    function call).
  - Corrected the error code returned by the math routines when an out of data
    memory condition is detected.

Version 0.8.0.0 (compiler 0.8.0.0, engine 0.8.0.0) - not released:
- Compiler:
  - Added variable symbol syntax: `var_name.
  - Added symbol names to the source info file.
  - Added **kwargs support to function calls and definitions.
  - Removed output files on detection of error(s).
- Engine:
  - Added ability to pass ranges, strings, lists, sets, and dictionaries as
    iterable group arguments (*args). Previously, only tuples were accepted.
  - Added support for functions accepting variable-length keyword arguments
    (**kwargs), using variable symbols as keys instead of strings.
- Application specification generator:
  - Added the ability to define extra symbols for use in the application
    without assigning a value.
  - Added symbol macro definitions to the generated header.
- Information utility:
  - Added symbol to name translation.

Version 0.7.4.0 (compiler 0.7.2.0, engine 0.7.6.0):
- Compiler:
  - Modified lexical analysis to treat negative integers as single tokens
    (instead of a unary negation token followed by a positive integer) in order
    to accept the most negative value (i.e., INT32_MIN) as a constant.
  - Replaced local implementation of integer arithmetic used in constant
    folding with calls to the same routines that the engine uses for these
    operations, thus making constant folding behave similar to Python rather
    than C.
- Engine:
  - Fixed several issues related to integer arithmetic, including undefined
    behaviour and overflow.
  - Corrected the behaviour of integer division and modulo operations to be
    similar to Python instead of C.
  - Fixed overflow conditions happening during range iteration.
  - Added checks to the script-callable int function for floating-point
    infinities and NaNs, and added an option to indicate how to handle them.
  - Fixed a bug in the script-callable tuple and list conversion functions that
    would occur when converting ranges with negative step.

Version 0.7.3.2 (compiler 0.7.1.5, engine 0.7.5.1):
- Engine:
  - Added cycle detection logic where applicable to end script execution when
    encountering self-referencial data structures.
  - Fixed some issues that would only arise from incorrect code (found during
    fuzz testing).
- Standalone application:
  - Fixed an issue in the print function to do with output of strings
    containing null bytes.
- Information utility:
  - Added hexadecimal display of error codes alongside the decimal values.

    anywhere, regardless of indent level, but they were being flagged as
    syntax errors.
- Engine:
  - Added support for application object types.
  - Fixed a number of issues discovered during fuzz testing.
  - Fixed bugs in some AspIs* functions.
- Standalone application:
  - Replaced use of malloc/free with new/delete.
- Build:
  - Relaxed the version of CMake required to 3.5 in order to support older
    systems.

- Special thanks to Lassi Hamalainen for suggesting all of these changes.
- Compiler:
  - Added -o option to specify the names of the output files.
- Engine:
  - Fixed a bug in AspNewBoolean which would crash if the singleton allocation
    failed.
  - Added AspSealCode to allow use of script executable code residing outside
    the engine's normal code area.
- Standalone application:
  - Updated to use new AspSealCode except when the code size is specified via
    the appropriate command line option.
- General:
  - Added support for file name arguments that start with an option prefix.
    This affects aspc, aspinfo, and asps.
  - Clarified licensing.
- Build:
  - Standardized path name separator, file name separators, and command line
    option prefixes for each supported platform. These are no longer build
    options.
  - Decoupled debug output generation from the Debug build configuration.

Version 0.7.2.1 (compiler 0.7.1.3, engine 0.7.4.1):
- Engine:

      operator (str % tuple).

Version 0.7.1.5 (compiler 0.7.1.3, engine 0.7.3.4):
- Compiler:
  - Added an error for the wildcard form of the from...import statement.
- Engine:
  - Changed the way null characters in strings are rendered in conversions
    to string. Was '\x00', is now '\0'.
  - Made MKR* instructions more memory efficient when explicit default values
    are encountered.
  - Implemented the string formatting operator (str % tuple).
  - Made some library script functions more like Python:
    - Added an optional base parameter to the int function. The default base
      for string conversions is 10.
    - Added an optional base parameter to the log function. The default base
      is e, yielding the natural logarithm.

    dictionaries is different than Python.
  - Added API functions for creating ranges.
- Standalone application:
  - Added optional sep and end parameters to the print function to make it
    more like Python.

Version 0.7.1.4 (compiler 0.7.1.2, engine 0.7.3.3):
- Engine:
  - Added codec script library routines for encoding/decoding numeric data
    to/from binary representations for use in applications that require this
    functionality. Note that these routines are not available in the standalone
    application.

Version 0.7.1.3 (compiler 0.7.1.2, engine 0.7.3.2):
- Added ability to build under Windows.
- Reformatted help information displayed by the compiler, the standalone
  application, and the info utility.
- Standalone application:
  - Added sleep script function.

Version 0.7.1.2 (compiler 0.7.1.1, engine 0.7.3.1):
- Compiler:
  - Added generation of the source info file (.aspd).
  - Added -v option to print version information and exit.
- Info library and utility (new):

    reporting and tracing applications.
  - Added a utility for performing the functions of the above library.
- Standalone application:
  - Added error code and program counter translation via the new info library.

Version 0.7.1.1 (compiler 0.7.1.0, engine 0.7.3.1):
- Engine:
  - Ensured that global overrides for variables that do not exist locally
    do not leave a vestigial local variable when the global override is removed.
- Application specification generator:
  - Fixed a bug that caused the generator to hang when a lone period was
    encountered.
